# Image Segmentation with U-Net


## Overview

Welcome to the **Image Segmentation with U-Net** repository. This project utilizes the U-Net architecture for accurate and efficient image segmentation. Whether you are working on medical imaging, satellite image analysis, or any other domain requiring precise object localization, this repository provides a robust solution.

## Features

- **U-Net Architecture**: Leverage the power of the **U-Net** convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation.

- **Flexible Integration**: Easily integrate the **U-Net** model into your projects for diverse image segmentation applications.

- **Training and Inference**: Train the **U-Net** model on your custom datasets or use pre-trained models for quick inference.

- **Customization**: Fine-tune **U-Net** parameters and hyperparameters to meet the specific requirements of your segmentation task.

## U-Net Architecture

[U-Net](link-to-u-net-paper) is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for semantic segmentation tasks. It consists of a contracting path, a bottleneck, and an expansive path. The architecture is renowned for its ability to capture fine details while also maintaining contextual information, making it particularly effective for image segmentation.

### Overview

The U-Net architecture can be divided into the following key components:

1. **Contracting Path:**
   - Consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers.
   - Captures context and reduces spatial resolution.

2. **Bottleneck:**
   - Located at the center of the network.
   - Serves as a bridge between the contracting and expansive paths.
   - Retains high-level semantic information.

3. **Expansive Path:**
   - Involves up-sampling and concatenation operations.
   - Restores spatial resolution and refines segmentation predictions.

### Usage in this Project

In this project, the U-Net architecture is employed for image segmentation tasks. The `unet.py` file in the repository contains the implementation of the U-Net model.

Feel free to explore the U-Net architecture further in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) for a detailed understanding.
